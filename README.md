Computes the $`\alpha`$-$`\alpha`$ phase shift for a given parametrisation of the nuclear potential.

Solves the 1-dimensional Schrodinger equation by placing the system in a large box, as described in the [scattering primer](docs/scattering_primer.pdf).

In addition to computing the $`\alpha`$-$`\alpha`$ phase shift, the [pyaa.py](pyaa.py) script computes the capture rate to a Gaussian final state. 

Running the script should produce the below figure.
